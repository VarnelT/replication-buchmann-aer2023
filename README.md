# Replication & Extension: A Signal to End Child Marriage

### Overview
This repository contains a replication and methodological extension of the paper:
**"A Signal to End Child Marriage: Theory and Experimental Evidence from Bangladesh"**
*Authors: Buchmann, Field, Glennerster, Nazneen, Wang*
*Published in: American Economic Review (2023)*

### Objective
This project serves as a research artifact to demonstrate proficiency in applied econometrics and causal inference. It is divided into two parts:
1.  **Replication (Step A):** Reproducing the main experimental results (RCT) regarding the impact of financial incentives on child marriage.
2.  **Causal ML Extension (Step B):** Investigating Heterogeneous Treatment Effects (HTE) using advanced machine learning estimators (**Causal Forests**, **DoubleML**) to identify which subgroups benefit most from the intervention.

### Methodology
* **Language:** Python (using `pandas`, `statsmodels`, `DoubleML`, `EconML`) / R.
* **Identification:** Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) & Difference-in-Differences.
* **Machine Learning:** Causal Forests for CATE estimation.

### Data
The raw data is not included in this repository due to size constraints. To replicate the results, please download the files from OpenICPSR (Project ID: 192114) and place them in a data/ folder
